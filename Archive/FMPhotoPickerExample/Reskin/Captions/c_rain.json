  "Let a smile be your umbrella on a rainy day.",
  "Rain showers my spirit and waters my soul.",
  "Thy fate is the common fate of all; Into each life, some rain must fall.",
  "I’m singing in the rain, just singing in the rain; What a wonderful feeling, I’m happy again.",
  "I love the rain. I want the feeling of it on my face.",
  "I need the seasons to live to the rhythm of rain and sun.",
  "The summer sun was not meant for boys like me. Boys like me belonged to the rain.",
  "Like a welcome summer rain, humor may suddenly cleanse and cool the earth, the air and you.",
  "Everybody wants happiness, and nobody wants pain, but you can’t have a rainbow without a little rain.",
  "I love the smell of rain, and I love the sound of the ocean waves.",
  "Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm but to add color to my sunset sky.",
  "Rainy days should be spent at home with a cup of tea and a good book.",
  "A rainy day is the perfect time for a walk in the woods.",
  "Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet.",
  "I love the rain. It’s my favorite weather.",
  "Rainy days are perfect for cuddling up with a warm blanket, my laptop, a good book, the remote and a nice cup of something warm!",
  "This rain makes me miss you even more.",
  "If people were like rain, I was like drizzle and she was a hurricane.",
  "Don’t threaten me with love, baby. Let’s just go walking in the rain.",
  "Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby.",
  "Rain is not only drops of water. Its the love of sky for the earth. They never meet each other but sends love this way.",
  "I believe in running through the rain and crashing into the person you love and having your lips bleed on each other.",
  "The sound of the rain needs no translation.",
  "The person who dances with you in the rain will most likely walk with you in the storms.",
  "If I were rain, That joins sky and earth that otherwise never touch, Could I join two hearts as well?",
  "Oh, come forth into the storm and rout And be my love in the rain.",
  "Oh my love, it’s you that I dream of, Oh my love, since that day somewhere in my heart I’m always dancing with you in the summer rain.",
  "Save a boyfriend for a rainy day – and another, in case it doesn’t rain.",
  "So it’s raining, you aren’t sugar you won’t melt so enjoy it.",
  "Rainy days give people like me a special kind of motivation- the motivation to do absolutely nothing.",
  "The best thing one can do when it’s raining is to let it rain.",
  "Do not be angry with the rain; it simply does not know how to fall upwards.",
  "Dear Sun, I know you’re up there hiding behind the clouds. Hide and seek is over, let’s have some sunshine!",
  "Is there ever a better time to watch your favorite flicks than on those thundery days?",
  "People say that they love the rain but then they take cover when it starts to pour on them.",
  "You’re never too old to jump in the puddles and splash in the rain.",
  "I always feel sorry for people who think more about a rainy day ahead than sunshine today.",
  "When life gives you a rainy day… Play in the puddles.",
  "Don’t forget to dance in the rain!",
  "Do not, on a rainy day, ask your child what he feels like doing, because I assure you that what he feels like doing, you won’t feel like watching.",
  "Every heartache will fade away, just like every storm runs out of the rain.",
  "And when it rains on your parade, look up rather than down. Without the rain, there would be no rainbow.",
  "Heavy rain showers remind me of challenges in life. Never ask for a lighter rain. Instead, pray for a better umbrella.",
  "Life’s not about waiting for the storm to pass… It’s about Learning To Dance In The Rain.",
  "One thing a mother must always save for a rainy day is patience.",
  "The rain cools the air, calms the soul and replenishes life.",
  "Anyone who thinks that sunshine is pure happiness, has never danced in the rain.",
  "Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.",
  "There’s nothing better than curling up with a good book on rainy days.",
  "I’ve always found the rain very calming.",
  "I love rain. It’s lucky, I always think.",
  "I always like walking in the rain, so no one can see me crying.",
  "All was silent as before, all silent save the dripping rain.",
  "Just know I’m right here hoping, That you’ll come in with the rain.",
  "Tears fall in my heart like the rain on the town.",
  "I open up the curtains\/ To hear the thunder and the rain.",
  "For lonely people, rain is a chance to be touched.",
  "I love the rain – it washes memories off the sidewalk of life.",
  "The sun did not shine. It was too wet to play. So we sat in the house. All that cold, cold, wet day.",
  "Tears of joy are like the summer rain drops pierced by sunbeams.",
  "One can find so many pains when the rain is falling.",
  "Would you light the night and make the sunshine rain\/ Would you take it all and make it alright?",
  "After the rain, the sun will reappear. There is life. After the pain, the joy will still be here.",
  "The drop of rain maketh a hole in the stone, not by violence, but by oft falling.",
  "Let a smile be your umbrella on a rainy day.",
  "Rain showers my spirit and waters my soul.",
  "Thy fate is the common fate of all; Into each life, some rain must fall.",
  "I’m singing in the rain, just singing in the rain; What a wonderful feeling, I’m happy again.",
