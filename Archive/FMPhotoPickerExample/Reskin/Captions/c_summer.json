  "The end-of-summer winds make people restless.",
  "Watching the summer close is like watching a good kid die for no apparent reason.",
  "The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer.",
  "If June was the beginning of a hopeful summer, and July the juice middle, August was suddenly feeling like the bitter end.",
  "September tries its best to have us forget summer.",
  "August rain: the best of the summer gone, and the new fall not yet born. The odd uneven time.",
  "When the winter comes, the summer shines infinitely in our hearts!",
  "Summer is a promissory note signed in June, its long days spent and gone before you know it, and due to be repaid next January.",
  "What good is the warmth of summer, without the cold of winter to give it sweetness.",
  "The end-of-summer winds make people restless.",

  "She got incredibly hot over last summer…",
  "Oh Summer hurry up! I can’t wait to get salty.",
  "Bikini ready saying hurry up Summer… I’m missing you!",

  "Just living is not enough … one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.",
  "A thin grey fog hung over the city, and the streets were very cold; for summer was in England.",
  "I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always June.",
  "A breeze, a forgotten summer, a smile, all can fit into a storefront window.",
  "In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold. All the floors were rotten. Filth on the floors an inch thick; one could slip and fall…",
  "O, Sunlight! The most precious gold to be found on Earth.",
