  "You’re cute, can I have you?",
  "I’m much more me when I’m with you.",
  "Take my hand and we’ll make it – I swear!",
  "I just want to cuddle, that’s all I want.",
  "Loving you never was an option. It was a necessity.",
  "In an instant and forever, love can make a fool seem clever.",
  "Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.",
  "Real men invest in long-term love, not short-term lust.",

  "Love doesn’t make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.",
  "I carry your heart with me, I carry it in my heart. I am never without it.",
  "Love is like water; we can fall into it, we can drown in it and we can’t live without it.",
  "I need you like a heart needs a beat.",
  "Without His love I can do nothing, with His love there is nothing I cannot do.",
  "The real power of a man is in the size of the smile of the woman sitting next to him.",
  "You are the only source of my joy, the center of my universe and the whole of my being.",
  "I look at you and see the rest of my life in front of my eyes.",

  "There are only two times that I want to be with you. Now and Forever.",
  "All, everything that I understand, I only understand because I love.",
  "I swear I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow.",
  "Our Relationship is meant to be. Something that was written in the stars and drawn into our destiny.",
  "A real man won’t date the most beautiful girl in the world – he’ll date the girl that makes this world beautiful to him.",
  "Don’t lie, you know you want me!",
  "You’re like a dictionary you add meaning to my life!",
  "I like me a little bit more when I’m with you.",
  "I love you like a fat kid love cake.",
  " Besides chocolate you’re my favorite.",
  "Love is a sweet dream and marriage is the alarm clock.",
  "If love is the answer, could you rephrase the question?",
  "All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt.",
  "Romantic love is mental illness. But it’s a pleasurable one.",
  "Love is an electric blanket with somebody else in control of the switch.",
  "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.",
  "Love is a lot like a backache: it doesn’t show up on X-rays, but you know it’s there.",
  "Don’t worry if you haven’t found your true love, they’re just with someone else right now.",
  "There is only one kind of love, but there are thousands of different copies.",
  "Don’t make love by the garden gate, love is blind but the neighbors ain’t.",

  "Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell.",
  "Nothing is impossible to pure love.",
  "True love begins when nothing is looked for in return.",
  "This is true love! Do you think this happens every day?",
  "It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.",
  "With the power of love; our two hearts can enlighten the whole world.",
  "It is true that my heart always skips a beat when you take my name.",
  "True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked.",
  "I know I am in love with you because my reality is finally better than my dreams.",
  "Love is not the opposite of power. Love is power. Love is the strongest power there is.",
  "I’m truly, completely, overwhelmingly, passionately, deliciously and spectacularly in love with you.",
  "Life goes on… with or without you.",
  "Take away love and our earth is a tomb.",
  "Love wasn’t put in your heart to stay. Love isn’t loving till you give it away.",
  "Some of us think holding on makes us strong, but sometimes it is letting go.",
  "Truth is, I’m crazy for you. And everyone can see that but you!",
  "The saddest thing in the world is loving someone who used to love you.",
  "When you are in love and you get hurt, it is like a cut… it will heal, but there will always be a scar.",
  "Sometimes your eyes are not the only place the tears fall.",
  "You flew off with the wings of my heart and left me flightless.",
