  "You are my greatest adventure.",
  "Listening to her heartbeat, ‘I love you’ He said.”",
  "You’re that part of me I’ll always need.",
  "Is he cute huh? Yeah, he’s mine and I’m psycho!",
  "You are my sunshine in a cloudy sky, you make me so happy, darling.",
  "I don’t need a knight in shining armor; a sweet boy in old jeans will do just fine.",
  "I know you think I’m crazy. Maybe that’s because I am. About life, about this moment, about you.",
  "His whisper was the softest sound I ever knew, which seemed to bring the loudest heartbeat.",
  "Without His love I can do nothing, with His love there is nothing I cannot do.",
  "You are my best friend, my human diary and my other half. You mean the world to me and I love you.",
  "You cannot leave everything to Fate, boy. She’s got a lot to do. Sometimes you must give her a hand.",
  "I don’t call you handsome, sir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you. Don’t flatter me.",
  "He calls me beautiful like it’s my name.",
  "Yeah, I know he’s cute but he’s mine. Touch him and I’ll kill you.",
  "I didn’t fall for you, you tripped me and I landed in your arms.",
  "Let’s cuddle so I can steal your body heat…",
  "Give a girl a boyfriend and she becomes a total expert on relationships.",
  "I like your last name. Can I have it?",
  "I love you with all my butt, I would say heart but my butt is bigger.",
  "But, my God, it’s so beautiful when the boy smiles.",
  "You are my glue. Without you, I’d be nothing but broken pieces.",
  "I want you today, tomorrow, next week, and for the rest of my life.",
  "He’s annoying he’s hilarious, he makes me yell, he drives me crazy, he’s out of his mind but he’s everything I want.",
  "You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete.",
  "Could I hold your hands for a moment, and your heart forever?",
  "He makes my world go round and turns my frown upside down.",
  "Within you, I lose myself. Without you, I find myself wanting to be lost again.",
  "There is a warmth in your eyes, one I can feel even when you’re not around.",
  "If someone asked me to describe you in just 2 words, I’d say… Simply amazing.",
  "But I must admit, I miss you quite terribly. The world is too quiet without you nearby.",
  "It’s when we kiss that I feel your blood within my veins and your heartbeat within my soul.",
  "And don’t forget… I’m also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.",
  "I held him close and said nothing, all the while telling him silently that he was loved. Oh, but he was loved.",
  "Nobody loves a woman because she is handsome or ugly, stupid or intelligent. We love because we love.",
  "You are my so dear one, whom I can’t leave behind. You will be always in my heart and I will love you, life after life.",
  "Love is the heartbeat of life.",
  "I love you more than yesterday, less than tomorrow.",
  "The curves of your lips rewrite history.",
  "It’s when I hear your heartbeat that I know that I am alive.",
  "I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times, in life after life, in age after age forever.",
  "Life without you is like a broken pencil: pointless.",
  "I put a tear in the ocean; when you find it, I’ll stop loving you.",
  "I fall in love with you every time I look into your beautiful eyes.",
  "You are my North, my South, my East and West, my working week and my Sunday rest.",
  "In search of that beat that my heart skipped when I first saw your beautiful soul…",
  "If I had to choose between breathing and loving you, I would use my last breath to say, I love you.",
  "My love for you is like a circle—it has no beginning and will know of no end.",
  "You are my greatest adventure.",
  "Listening to her heartbeat, ‘I love you’ He said.”",
  "You’re that part of me I’ll always need.",
