  "My life is a collection of sad moments and comparatively less sad moments.",
  "Life is that boss of yours who gets you worked so hard but pays too little.",
  "The only thing that is certain in life is that it’ll steal everything you love.",
  "The ugly truth is no one is really happy in their life.",
  "Expect less. Because you are not getting more anyway.",
  "Monsters don’t sleep under your bed, they scream inside of your head.",
  "There is no greater sorrow than to recall the misery in time we were happy.",
  "Tears are the summer showers to the soul.",
  "The sad truth is that opportunity doesn’t knock twice.",
  "I’m busy saving everybody else when I can’t even save myself.",
  "Deep inside where nothing’s fine, I’ve lost my mind.",
  "Tears are words that need to be written.",
  "I used to think love brings happiness. But then I hit the reality.",
  "Sadness is the final product of love.",
  "I haven’t cried enough, you never loved enough.",
  "Love is blind. It couldn’t see that I was hurt.",
  "My life was going well but then I fell in love.",
  "Love is the person you think about during the sad songs.",
  "You made me cry, you told me lies, but I can’t stand to say goodbye.",
  "The saddest thing in the world is loving someone who used to love you.",
  "So it’s true when all is said and done, grief is the price we pay for love.",
  "I have nothing to say you but it does not mean I can not hear you.",
  "I have cried because of one reason that is you.",
  "It’s easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die.",
  "If one day you feel like crying, call me. I can’t promise to make you laugh but I’m willing to cry with you.",
  "Trying to forget someone you loved is like trying to remember someone you never know.",
  "Sometimes, crying is the only way your eyes speak when your mouth can’t explain how broken your heart is.",
  "I can’t remember when the last time I smiled.",
  "I think I was born with a built-in feature called sadness. Now it’s turned on.",
  "I’ve never felt sadness like this in my entire life.",
  "Sadness is the only human feeling I’ve known in my life.",
  "I sleep to escape from reality.",
  "I draw with silver and it turns red.",
  "I always like walking in the rain, so no one can see me crying.",
  "I don’t need a particular reason to be sad. It’s just how my life is.",
  "I smile all the time so that nobody knows how broken I’m inside.",
  "I’ll be alright. One day. Someday. Just not today.",
  "I just wanna feel okay again.",
  "I smile not for that I am happy, but sometimes I smile to hide sadness",
  "You can see many smiles every day, but you can never know whose world is actually upside down.",
  "Everything is a battle, every breath is a war, and I don’t think I’m winning anymore.",
  "You knew exactly what you were doing, that’s what hurts the most.",
  "I have a thousand reasons to die and many millions of tears to cry.",
