  "I want you, nothing else, just you.",
  "Iloveyou; I wrote it with no spaces so there’s no room for anyone else.",
  "My past will never haunt me, as long as I have you, sweetie.",
  "You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.",
  "That’s my sweetheart in there. Wherever she is, that’s where my home is.",
  "I don’t care, whether it is a selfie or a belfie – any photo that has you in it, makes me go crazy.",
  "With your love and care, I feel like I can conquer the whole wide world.",
  "I want to be the only guy to be in your heart because you are the only girl in mine – now and forever.",
  "Your smile is the only inspiration I need. Your voice is the only motivation I need. Your love is the only happiness I need.",
  "Just like how Instagram is incomplete without those mellow hues, my life is incomplete without you.",
  "I knew I was in love when I stopped thinking about how pretty you look and started seeing the beauty within you.",
  "The more I’ve gotten to know you, the more I’ve realized how awesome you are.",
  "I am going to stop calling you my girlfriend because you are not a girl, you are an angel.",
  "Your love is not one of the things I need to survive – it is the ONLY thing I need to survive.",
  "I must be the luckiest guy alive because every day I meet the girl who I saw in my dreams the previous night.",
  "You make me want to be a better man.",
  "And when I’m with her, I feel happy to be alive. Like I can do anything.",
  "Attraction brought us closer. Love’s gonna keep us that way, forever.",
  "Loving you is not a choice or an option. It is a need and a necessity. I love you.",
  "Your love is the only armor I need to fight all of life’s battles.",
  "I may or may not be a prince, but you are nothing less than a princess.",
  "Regardless of life’s ups and downs, you’re the sunshine that wipes away my frowns.",
  "I learned the meaning of love from you; you are the best thing given to me by God.",
  "You are the reason I can be happy even when I am sad and smile even when I cry.",
  "I care for you and you care for me, you make everything so easy for me to run my days.",
  "Winters… best spent in the warmth of your arms. I love you.",
  "Every time I see you smile is a moment that makes all of life’s troubles worth tolerating.",
  "I love her and that’s the beginning and end of everything.",
  "Life without the one I love is like a broken pencil – it is pointless.",
  "I don’t care if we were meant to be or not, but I do know that I love you a lot.",
  "Not even the ugliest monsters can scare me as much as I feel scared when I am away from you.",
  "I am not asking for a lot… all I want to do is hold your hand. I miss you.",
  "A sunset without you is as good as a sunrise that never happened. I miss you.",
  "I never have to intentionally THINK about you because you are always in my THOUGHTS. I miss you girl.",
  "A day spent away from you, is as good as a day not worth being alive.",
  "The only word to describe you is MINE and the only word to describe us, is FOREVER.",
  "Do you feel that? Can you hear it? That is my heart, beating for you. I miss you.",
  "Am I alive or am I dead? I really can’t see the difference when I miss you. Meet me soon sweetheart.",
  "If my heart had legs it would run after you all day long.",
  "You must be a dictionary because you add meaning to my life.",
  "The spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly.",
  "I am going to call the cops. It must be illegal to be as fine as you.",
  "Morning or afternoon, evening or night, I will always love you with all my might.",
  "Your heart is the only WiFi that I want to stay connected all-time.",
  "Sit down and give those legs a rest. You’ve been running through my mind all day.",
  "God is such a show-off. He sent you to make all of the other women in the world jealous.",
  "I don’t know about physics or math but the chemistry between us is definitely sizzling.",
  "To survive, humans need air, food, and water. I just need your hugs, smiles, and kisses. I love you.",
  "I don’t know how you got inside my heart, but I do know that I never want you to leave.",
  "If you ask to pick between you and my dreams, It’s gonna tough because being with you is my only dream.",
  "I want you, nothing else, just you.",
