  "Your eyes make me shy.",
  "You stole my heart, but I’ll let you keep it.",
  "You are my favorite daydream.",
  "You make my dopamine levels go all silly.",
  "You don’t have to be a genius to figure what’s between us.",
  "I think about you constantly, whether it’s with my mind or my heart.",
  "Just thinking about you brings a smile to face, a twinkle to my eye, and a skipped beat to my heart.",
  "If I had a single flower for every time I think of you, I could walk forever in my garden.",
  "Sometimes I just can’t ignore the way I feel when I see you smile.",
  "Ever since I met you, it hasn’t been the same. All you’ve got me doing is drawing hearts around your name.",
  "It’s nice to have a crush on someone. It feels like you’re alive, you know?",
  "I’ve found this new disease, it’s called LOVE. I know it is contagious because you gave it to me.",
  "Because of your smile, you make life more beautiful.",
  "When I see you, I admit I start to lose my grip and all of my cool.",
  "Loving you is like breathing How can I stop?",
  "It’s amazing how crazy I feel when my phone vibrates and I’m, begging it to be you.",
  "Why do they call it a crush? Because that’s how you feel when they don’t feel the same way in return.",
  "My insides still turn over when he looks at me that certain way.",
  "Dear heart, so there’s the guy that you want me to like but I don’t want to, so can you stop beating so fast when he comes by?",
  "I want to touch with my mouth. His mouth, with my mouth. Maybe his neck, too. But first things first: Make him aware I exist.",
  "Someone stole my heart. Can I check your pockets?",
  "Sometimes all it takes to make my day is a glimpse of you.",
  "He had beautiful eyes. The kind you could get lost in and I guess I did.",
  "Dear Diary, I saw him, and he smiled at me.",
  "I fell in love with you. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. I just did.",
  "I was praying the someday, you would notice me and tell me that you love me like I pictured you would in my countless daydreams about us.",
  "I’m not going to make a big deal about a few tummy flutters because…dead people, old people, even furniture would get butterflies if they met this guy.",
  "Sometimes I wish I would be able to catch his attention and he will tell me that he likes me the way I like him.",
  "When you have a crush, it’s hard to focus on your activities because he is all you think about all day.",
  "She’s a walkin’, talkin’ reason to live.",
  "I stare at you when you are not looking.",
  "She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket.",
  "I sit and wonder if you’ll ever understand just how much of me belongs to you.",
  "When you fall for someone for who she really is, everything about her becomes beautiful.",
  "I have a crush on your mind, I feel for your personality and your looks are just a big bonus.",
  "When you are online, I stare at your name waiting for you to say Hi.",
  "I like her because she smiles at me and means it.",
  "It is hard to pretend to like someone you don’t, but even harder to pretend to not like someone when you really do.",
  "Today I caught myself smiling for no reason… then I realized I was thinking of you.",
  "I think of you so much that I see you almost everywhere I go.",
  "You know you really like someone when you sit the painful way in your chair just to get a better look at them.",
  "I smile whenever I think of you but try to display a poker face whenever you are around.",
  "Lol, today you said “Hi” to me and I died.",
  "I just had to talk with you. Sweetness is my weakness.",
  "The mark of a true crush… is that you fall in love first and grope for reasons afterward.",
  "Crushes are more beautiful than affairs because there is no responsibility, no worry, no commitment. Just look at your crush and smile like an idiot.",
  "The spaces between your fingers are meant to be filled with mine.",
  "If I were to become an animal, I would be a cat. Because I want to love you until the day I die… and the 8 more lives after that.",
  "If my love for you is a crime, I want to be the most wanted criminal.",
  "That awkward moment when your crush asks you who you like.",
  "When I bake cookies, I always think of you. Cookies smell fresh and good, and it makes me happy just like you.",
  "If I got a penny every time I thought and dreamed about you, I would be rich.",
  "You can’t be real. May I pinch you to see if I’m dreaming?",
  "My first name and your last name would sound great together.",
  "Don’t be scared if a big fat man comes into your room and stuffs you in a bag… I told Santa I want you for Christmas!",
  "I want you to want me. I want to be with you. I want you to make me yours.",
  "My head says, “Who Cares”? But then my heart whispers, “You Do, Stupid”.",
  "The truth is, I’m crazy for you and everyone can see that, but you.",
  "To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed.",
  "Isn’t it funny how just one little phone call or text can make your bad day suddenly wonderful!",
  "When I’m alone, I think of so many things to say to you, but when I have a chance to tell you, I go speechless.",
  "I know I am but summer to your heart, and not the full four seasons of the year.",
  "You know that feeling when your head says no, but your heart says yes? It’s wrong, but it feels so right? I wish we could be together.",
  "I’ll be yours forever, just tell me when to start.",
  "I’m waiting for the day when you’ll tell me that you’re thinking about me all the time.",
  "I’ll never get over the stupid feeling I get every time you sign on. The one where I think maybe, just maybe… you’ll talk to me first.",
  "Your eyes make me shy.",
  "You stole my heart, but I’ll let you keep it.",
  "You are my favorite daydream.",
  "You make my dopamine levels go all silly.",
